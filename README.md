malloc-lab
==========

This was a project for the course Introduction to Computer Systems (15-213) at Carnegie Mellon University. 
It is an implementation of malloc written in C. The implementation is based on the segregated free list model 
for dynamic memory allocation.

It is against CMU's academic integrity policy to post the code to a public repository. 
If you are interested in seeing the source, feel free to contact me by email.
